<i>(Featured!)</i>
<br />
Cofax is a web-based text and multimedia publication system. It was designed to simplify the presentation of newspapers on the Web and to expedite real-time Web publication. 

It was designed originally at Knight Ridder to serve the content for several of its newspapers, including its largest, the Philadelphia Inquirer and Philadelphia Daily News. Cofax was the tool it used to manage and build numerous web sites across its network for two years. Cofax source code and technologies continue to be an integral part of KR Digitals's current SDP content management system.

Currently, Cofax is used across the world as an open source, scalable and powerful content management solution provided by numerous independent solution providers.

    runs as as a Unix Daemon or Windows NT service and watches a specified folder for new
    incoming files or folders. As new files or folders appear inside the folder, it uses
    dynamically loaded handler classes to take action on those files and folders. This is
    often used to create <b>ftp drop folders</b> where whenever new files come in, they are
    given to a processing program. This can also be used for content replication across
    mirrorred servers. When one or more files in a watched folder change, the handler class
    called can automatically copy them over to the mirror servers. (Source code and
    instructions on installing it as a WinNT service provided.)</td>

    <td><a name="inlclude_url"></a> <font size="+2">include_url.java</font> This program
    overcomes a limitation of the .shtml <code>&lt;!--#include virtual=&quot;URL&quot; --&gt;</code>
    tag that includes a URL from the same server into the page. This web server-side Java
    object allows a page to include a remote URL in itself. <b>One of its uses is to get a
    block of HTML from a remote ad server that includes a link to the advertiser, the ad
    image, some accompanying text and even scripts and applets</b>. The commonly used method
    of using an <code>&lt;img src=&quot;http://ad-server/cgi-bin/getad?name&quot;&gt;</code>
    can only include an image, but nothing else around it. Combined with a cluster of ad
    servers, this makes it possible to rotate ads of any type -- image, multimedia, html,
    script, applet, anything. I wrote this as a tutorial on using Java with Active Server
    Pages (ASP) to create ASP components in Java. However, this is not limited to ActiveX
    technology and can be used with any web server that allows server side Java (even if via
    CGI or shtml exec). (view source <a

    Then, you can select code again, and choose uncomment to remove the comment marks. Since
    Java does not support conditional compilation, this is quite useful when developing Java
    programs. For Java files, these macros place (or remove) a <code>//</code> at (from) the
    beginning of each selected line. These macros know about and handle other languages like

    especially when many people work on the site. Also, when people upload files to the unix
    servers from PCs or MACs, the case may vary depending on program used to transfer, it's
    configuration, and the file name itself. Also, if your unix server shares a disk with an
    NT server using Samba or NFS, and you want to make it searchable using MS Index Server or
    NT based search program, this ensures that URLs will always work. It makes it easier for
    you to give out your urls without saying &quot;with an uppercase P and a lowercase
    u&quot;. If NT web servers do not care about case in URLs, why should unix ? (view source <a

    on your system. <br>
    Also, note the smart &quot;not found&quot; error handler page. When a page is not found on
    your server, it displays a message depending on how the was referred to the page. If you
    had a bad link, it says to. If someone else had a bad link, it asks you to contact them,
    not you. If they came from a bookmark or typed it in, then it tells them to check. <i>1996/Sep/22</i>
