<li><tt><b>PIN/Paperboy</b></tt>

- The complete, automatic, customizable system for Publishing
newspapers on the web.

<p>

Used by
<a href="http://www.philly.com">Philadelphia Online</a>
to daily automatically publish the www versions
of their two newspapers, The
<a href="http://www.phillynews.com/inq/front_page/">Philadelphia Inquirer</a>
and
<a href="http://www.phillynews.com/pdn/local/">The Philadelphia Daily News</a>.
Philadelphia Online is the Internet service of Philadelphia
Newspapers Incorporated, A Knight-Ridder Company.

<p>

The AI system written in GNU C++ and Perl automates the entire process of
fetching, conversion and posting from the Atex networks to the web servers.
It preserves fancy text attributes and formatting from the Atex files and
creates HTML pages that contain formatted html text with icons (stars,
bullets, pens, etc.) It creates index pages for each section of the
newspapers. It automatically posts photographs accompanying the stories,
editorial cartoons, and columnists photos with the articles.

<p>

It even indexes the newspapers using a complex context-keywords algorithm
for later searching as it builds them. Works well together with FreeWAIS as
well as Excite for web servers. Tested on Solaris 2.4, IRIX 5.4, AIX, and Linux.
Windows NT 4.0 version that will work with IIS2.0/SQL Server 6.5/MS Index Server
combination is under contruction.

<p>

Though the system is fully automated, it gives the online editors full
control to modify an online newspaper on a daily basis as required. If they
want, they can specify which stories will go up where and in which order
before the papers are posted.

<p>

<li>Philadelphia Online <tt><b>Clipper Service</b> / Personalized Newspapers</tt>

<p>

Extracts information from the entire Philadelphia Online website including
the two newspapers, classified ads, comics, horoscopes, daily packages and
more that match your profile.

<p>

This information is then placed on a set of web pages created especially for
you. Parts (or all) of the informaion can optionally be automatically
delivered to you by email.

<p>

<a name="bemailg"></a>
<li>

Send <b>emails from Atex to Internet and vice versa</b>!
Now implemented at the Philadelphia Inquirer and
the Philadelphia Daily News newspapers.
<p>

Every person who has an atex logon can send a message to
anyone on the internet as well as receive emails. No need for
newsroom people to learn a new mail program. This is a
transparent addition to the existing Atex message system
that they are used to. Also no need for network administrators
to set up or maintain new mailboxes anywhere.
<p>

Full firewall support as well as customizable security features
and logs.
<p>

One <tt><b>bemailg</b></tt> gateway interfaces with as many internal
atex networks as you have. A combination of the user's atex logon and
atex network name becomes their internet address at your domain. Also, it can
automatically generate aliases like Firstname.Lastname@newspaper.com.

Tested on Solaris 2.4, IRIX 5.4, AIX and Linux running Sendmail.
Will start work on Windows NT 4.0/Exchange Server version soon.

<li><tt><b>Mougli Website Indexing &amp; Search System</b></tt>

<p>

Used by Philadelphia Newspapers Incorporated to index and make searchable
the entire <a href="http://phillynews.com">phillynews.com</a> site.

<p>

<li><tt><b>Classified Ads on WWW System</b></tt>

- A companion to Paperboy. Takes
<a href="http://phillynews.com/ads/">classfied advertisements from a
newspaper</a>'s ad bank and databases them for searching and browsing via
CGI. This CGI program was the first classified ads system on the web to give
users a &quot;shopping basket&quot; feature. Users not only search and browse ads in
the databases of the two newspapers, they can even collect the ones they
want and have them come up on a page that they can save or print. This CGI
was the first such classied ads system on the web that made full use of the
limited CGI features to give interactivity and usefullness to the online ads
database.

<p>

<li><tt><b>crossword.cgi</b></tt>

- The web's first (and only ?)
<a href="http://phillynews.com/crossword/">CGI based crossword game</a>.

It uses real crosswords from the Philadelphia Inquirer and Daily News which
someone occasionally enters into the program. Has an easy to use interface
and works with any table supporting browser. There used to be a non-table
lynx version too.

<p>

Players can save their positions in the crosswords as bookmarks on their
browser. This way, the web server does not have to track who was where. This
was the first CGI puzzle/game that employed this bookmarking idea to let
users save their positions.
