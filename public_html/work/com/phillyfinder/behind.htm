<H3>History</H3>
<P>             
    PhillyFinder was             
    first unveiled at a meeting 
between PNI's Management and the Online Department in 1997. Rajiv presented 
them with a working version as a proof of concept for a unique web portal 
application. (I prefer working&nbsp;models to PowerPoint presentations.) Soon afterwards,
PhillyFinder was presented to the 
public as a beta site for preview. Users who used PhillyFinder loved it 
because it got them precise search returns. The Directory and Search
technologies designed for PhillyFinder have since then been used in several other
applications at 
philly.com.</P>
<P>On the Technology side, <STRONG>Karl Martino</STRONG>, <EM>Web Applications 
Programmer</EM>, did a 
  great job in making version 2.0 happen. Working with Rajiv, 
he created a new and improved editor interface for managing the portal, greatly 
improved the user interface making search results from various data sources work 
seamlessly together, and re-worked the database backend. <STRONG>Rajiv 
Pant</STRONG>, <EM>Manager of Technology &amp; Implementation</EM>, developed the pre-1.0 and 1.0 versions in 
1997.</P>
<P>On the Editorial side, <STRONG>Bob Jonason</STRONG>, <EM>Online Editor</EM>,<EM> </EM> 
  and <STRONG>Frank Donahue </STRONG>from the <EM>News Research Department </EM>    
 helped design the 1.0 application with their knowledge of Site Design 
and Library Science. <STRONG>Ches Wajda</STRONG>, <EM>Design Director</EM>,
worked on the user interface and graphic design for the 1.0 version. <STRONG>Jamie Sims </STRONG>and 
<STRONG>Saleema Syed </STRONG>who were then <EM>interns </EM>    with Philly Online helped 
manage the information in the database. <STRONG>Chris Kilbourne</STRONG>, <EM>Managing Editor</EM>, helped 
design the 2.0 feature set and user interface. Others in the Philly Online staff 
as well as the people who used the service and sent us their suggestions were
also intrumental in the development of the
product. Chris and Saleema along with other staff members now maintain the 
database.</P>
<P>(Note: The job titles mentioned above state the 
positions held be the person when they worked on that part of the project. They 
are all likely to have new titles by the time you read this.)</P>

<H3>Platform</H3>
<P>Both PhillyFinder version 1.0 and version 2.0 are currently powered by
Microsoft Technologies: NT 4.0 Server running IIS 4.0, Site Server 3.0 and SQL Server 7.0. 
The various pre 1.0 development versions of the software used FreeWais, Excite for 
Web Servers, in-house developed web spidering software developed by Rajiv, an in-house 
developed search engine by Rajiv, and a file-system/flat-files based database 
all on Unix. By using the above Microsoft technologies, we were able to focus on 
the integration, portal engine and editor interface and other things specific to 
PhillyFinder to make it a highly useful, usable and unique product. We did not 
have to develop and maintain the pre-1.0 code for the web spider, indexing 
engine, and file-system/flat-files based database system. With the limited time 
and resources that were allocated to PhillyFinder, we greatly benefited from 
having the MS Site Server 3.0/SQL Server 7.0 platform to build our 
application.</P>
