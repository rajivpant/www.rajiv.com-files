<a name="unique"><h2>What Makes PhillyFinder unique?</h2></a>
<p>
To paraphrase from the introduction: PhilllyFinder 
integrates two very useful capabilities: 1. browsing a list of web sites 2. 
searching web sites. It combines a web site indexing and search engine product 
with a directory product. The integration of a multiple web site search engine 
within a directory/portal system adds some unique functionality that the two 
stand alone products don't have.
<P>In this document we illustrate how PhillyFinder makes it possible to&nbsp;get 
results which would be difficult, if at all possible to do
with other search engine or directory products.
<p>
For an example of this, consider Yahoo. A user Alice who lives in 
Philadelphia wanted to travel to the Bahamas. She went to Yahoo and 
browsed to the category "/Recreation/Travel/By_Region/Countries/Bahamas/" 
as shown below.
<p>
<IMG alt="" border=0 height=413 src="unique1.GIF" width=634>
<p>
From within the Bahamas category, Alice searched for the word "resorts".  
She made sure to select "just this category" before clicking the search 
button as shown below.
<p>
<IMG alt="" border=0 height=369 src="unique2.GIF" width=765>
<p>
The first part of her results were fine as expected. 
Yahoo searched its directory for the word resorts and got back 
results only from sites listed within that category.
<p>
<IMG alt="" border=0 height=236 src="unique3.GIF" width=770>
<p>
The second part of her returns were fine as expected too. 
The "Yahoo Site Matches" brought back results that were limited to 
the Bahamas category and its subcategories as shown below.
<p>
<IMG alt="" border=0 height=369 src="unique2.GIF" width=765>
<p>
Not finding what she was looking for within Yahoo's directory of sites, 
she clicked on the "Web Pages" link to get results from full text 
searches on the web sites.
<IMG alt="" border=0 height=404 src="unique4.GIF" width=744>
<p>
To her dismay, the "Web Pages" search brought back results from 
resorts in Denver, Las Vegas and several other places. Most of the 
sites returned on top were not related to Bahamas. They didn't even 
contain the word Bahamas in them.
<p>
Being computers and Internet savvy, Alice realized that this 
was because that her search had now been forwarded to a search 
engine and that search engine was not integrated with the directory 
she was browsing.
<p>
She wished there was a site on the web that integrated a 
search engine with a portal directory. She started looking for one 
and found the only such site on the 
Internet - Phillyfinder at finder.philly.com!
<p>
This functionality unique to PhillyFinder gives it an edge 
over other search engines and directory products. It adds 
very useful functionality to allow people to find things 
on the Internet that were extremely difficult to find with 
other search engines. There are several examples of 
finding things on PhillyFinder that would be very 
difficult, if possible in other search engines.:
<ul>
<li>In PhillyFinder, Alice can browse to the category 
"Tourism &amp; Travel/Historical Sites" and search for the 
word "tickets". The full text search of the pages on 
sites returns ticket information, but only from the 
sites listed under "Historical Sites" and its subcategories. 
In other search engines, she would have to think hard 
to form a query that would return ticket information 
from only relevant sites. Results from movie theaters, 
performing arts theaters and others would clutter the results. 
<li>Another example would be searching for something, but 
  limit the search only to web sites of colleges in the Philadelphia area. In 
  any other search engine on the web, if at all possible to do, she would have 
  to enter the URL of each college to be included in her advanced search query. 
  In PhillyFinder, she just has to browse to the "Education/Colleges" category 
  and search only the sites listed below. In fact, If she wanted to, Alice could 
  even check the box next to the colleges whose web sites she wanted to search 
  and fine tune her search even more.</li>
