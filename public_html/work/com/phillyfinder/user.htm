<a name="intro"><h2>User Navigation</h2></a>
<p>
To 
navigate it has an easy to use menu bars, which are dynamically generated throughout. 
The   top navigation bar, above the search form, tells you where 
you are in a site, and allows simple tree based navigation:
<p>
<IMG alt="" border=0 height=104 src="Image1.gif" width=449>
<p>
Beneath the search form, to the left, is the category listing, dynamically 
tied to the category you are viewing.  To the right is that category's links 
and html content (note the check boxes, we will get back to them later when 
discussing search functionality):
<p>
<IMG alt="" border=0 height=410 src="Image2.gif" width=449>
<p>
If a category actually contains html, that is displayed above 
the links in one unified display:
<p>
<IMG alt="" border=0 height=511 src="Image3.gif" width=449>
<p>
If a user is going to execute a search they have a number of options.  
By default (and since this PhillyFinder is being used in the context of 
philly.com) the 'All' selection, in the drop down box, at the top, 
will return sites from our database, a seven day Philadelphia 
Inquirer and Daily News site server web site search, and a general web 
site search.  It is important to note the general web site search is 
performed on sites submitted to our database and indexed by our site 
server, in periods described in that URL's entry.  Also, site server 
daily indexes the Philadelphia Inquirer and Daily News and those 
results come from site server as well.  After the 'All' search the 
user has additional opportunity to filter further.  They can continue 
to view results from the Inquire, Daily News, or web sites, or they can 
use the checkboxes mentioned above.  
<p>
If a user chooses sites by clicking on a checkbox or series of 
checkboxes, types a search query, and clicks the 'Search' button 
the search is limited to results within those chosen sites.  
<p>
For example, the user has chosen the Inquirer and Daily News sports 
sections to search for results for the Flyers.
<p>
<IMG alt="" border=0 height=343 src="Image4.gif" width=436>
<p>
The site server filtered its search by the chosen URL's urlToSearch field.  
An editor fills in the urlToSearch field.  Our site server 
indexes content based upon this field and it's corresponding frequency 
field.
<p>
<IMG alt="" border=0 height=269 src="Image5.gif" width=445>
<p>
When you execute a search, with "Sites in this Category" picked, 
PhillyFinder queries our directory database, to get urlToSearch entries of all 
URLs entered in the category you are presently browsing and all of it's 
subcategories.  It passes this on as a filter to our Site Server, which 
then returns its results.
<p>
If a user executed this search:
<p>
<IMG alt="" border=0 height=244 src="Image6.gif" width=450>
<p>
These would be its results:
<p>
<IMG alt="" border=0 height=243 src="Image7.gif" width=457>
<p>
The drop down list also presents other useful search options for the user.  
It should be noted that these search options are easily replaced and/or 
modified to provide additional search capabilities if PhillyFinder was to 
be setup for other portals other than philly.com.
<p>
The search "<STRONG>Inquirer 7-day</STRONG>", 
"<STRONG>Daily News 7-day</STRONG>", "<STRONG>Entire Web</STRONG>", and 
"<STRONG>philly.com</STRONG>" options each return results from&nbsp;our search 
engine. "<STRONG>News Archives</STRONG>" redirects the search to an application 
at our parent company's&nbsp;site that hosts our newspaper's archives. 
"<STRONG>Yellow Pages</STRONG>" redirects the&nbsp;search to a content partner 
that provides Yellow Pages listings. "<STRONG>Help Wanted Ads</STRONG>
              
            
    " takes you to&nbsp;an application that 
searches the Sunday Classifieds&nbsp;from the newspapers at philly.com.
