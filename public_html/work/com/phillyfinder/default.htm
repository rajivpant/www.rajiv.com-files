<h1>About PhillyFinder</h1>

<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>
PhillyFinder, to an end-user, is an easy to use web directory 
portal with integrated search functionality.   To an editor, or web site 
builder, it is a framework to rapidly build and maintain a portal 
web site with extensive search capability and room to grow.  All
of this is acomplished with in the familiar setting of the browser.

<p>
It combines a web site indexing and search engine 
product with a directory product. The integration of a multiple web site search 
engine within a directory/portal system adds some unique functionality that the 
two stand alone products don't have. 
<P>In our case, being limited to searching only web sites related to 
Philadelphia which have been approved by editors makes it the ideal search 
engine to use to find Philadelphia related information. Also because the web 
sites it spiders and makes searchable are the ones that are listed in the 
portal's directory, unwanted sites such as those containing porn, or of 
questionable authenticity are kept out of search results.</P>
<P>The software is easily customizable to meet the needs of any site that needs 
integrated portal directory and search engine capabilities. Using the intuitive 
interface, site editors can create and&nbsp;manage their portal site with 
ease.</P>
