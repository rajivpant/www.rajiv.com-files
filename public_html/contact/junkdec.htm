<center><h1>Declaration by Rajiv Pant<br><small>To Organizations Involved in Direct Marketing</small></h1></center>
<center><h2>Version Jun 28 Copyright (C) 2003
 Rajiv Pant</h2></center>

T<small>AKE NOTICE</small> of my permissions
regarding messages to me and use of information about me.
<br>
This includes solicitations by mail and telephone,
and rental of my name in lists.
<h3>Rights in this Declaration</h3>
Copying, redistribution, modification and production of derived works
of this Declaration are permitted only under the
<a href="http://www.junkbusters.com/ht/en/gpl.html">
GNU General Public License</a> (GPL).
The copyright of the expositional parts of this document is 
held by Junkbusters Corporation and is used here by permission
under the GPL.
This Declaration comes with <strong>no warranty.</strong>
If clarification is needed refer first to the
<cite>Guide to Interpretation of Declarations</cite>
published by Junkbusters;
for copies of that guide see
<a href="http://www.junkbusters.com">

Copies of the GPL are available there or from the
Free Software Foundation,

Cambridge, MA 02139, USA.

<h3>Declaration of Permissions</h3>
<a name="demand">I ask</a>
that organizations who may wish to make solicitations to me
or to provide information about me to others
first check the the appropriate line
of the List of Organizations below
in order to determine my permissions concerning such acts.
Where the categories overlap the last line whose description is applicable
should be considered as the appropriate line.
These permissions remain in effect
until I change them by issuing another
Junkbusters Declaration or other explicit instructions to that effect.
If a URL is specified in the Identification section,
organizations involved in direct marketing are
encouraged to check it periodically
for revised versions of this Declaration.
Each such organization is addressed as ``you.''
If the line ``Permissions apply to all residents'' appears below,
``me'' and ``I'' should be interpreted to mean all
residents at my address.
<br><ul type="1">
<li>
<a name="xD">If the line begins with a</a>
<strong>``<font color=red>D</font>''</strong>
I deny you and your agents my permission to send me solicitations by mail,
and I specifically request that you include
my address(es) below in any and all
``do-not-mail'' lists under your control.
<li>
<a name="xP">If the line begins with a</a>
<strong>``P''</strong>
I permit you to send me solicitations by mail.
<li>
<a name="xW">If the line begins with a</a>
<strong>``<font color=green>W</font>''</strong>
I permit and encourage you to send me solicitations by mail.
</ul>
If one or more telephone numbers are listed in the Identification section,
I deny you permission to make telemarketing calls and
other unsolicited calls including market research surveys
to such numbers,
and I specifically request that you include any and all of
the numbers in all ``do-not-call'' lists under your control.
I also deny you permission to provide information about me
(other than than the contents of this Declaration
under the terms of the GPL) to any other entity.
I specifically request that you include my name on all lists
you maintain of consumers who do not wish to to have their names
rented or shared.
However, depending on your business practices
this may not suffice
to ensure that you do not use my name contrary to my permission,
so I ask that you take all other
necessary steps to ensure that
neither you nor your agents acting on your behalf do this.
If one or more electronic mail addresses is specified
in the Identification section,
I deny you permission to send solicitations by email to such addresses.
Notwithstanding anything above,
I offer you a license to use and
distribute the information in this Declaration
under the GPL,
and I also adopt the
standard exemptions
published by Junkbusters Corporation
as if written in the body of this Declaration.
I reserve my rights in the event that you act contrary to
what I have told you I permit.
Without in any way limiting these rights, you are advised that
I regard 90 days from the date of your receipt of this Declaration
as more than ample time for you to make the necessary preparations to
ensure that you do not act contrary to my permissions.
