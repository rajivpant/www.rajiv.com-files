<p>To Whom It May Concern:</p>

<p>In my long career as a journalist, and digital media
manager, I have learned that hiring the right people is probably the single
most important accomplishment an executive can make. Find great talent, nurture
it, let it bloom and then try to keep it – that was my strategy. (And I must
say, it was a recipe that worked … and brought a great deal of reflected glory
and success to me personally.)</p>

<p>In my three decades of journalism management, the last 11
years spent starting and running the Philly.com website for Knight Ridder, I
have made no hire more important or successful than that of Rajiv Pant. I was
lucky enough to find Rajiv back in 1995, when both he and the Internet were
young. Brought in as a software developer, he showed brilliant technical and
programming skills, as well as a strategic maturity that belied his age. Within
a couple of months, he was practically running the place, and the publisher of
The Philadelphia Inquirer was calling him in for chats about new online
publishing ideas. Another boss might have been threatened. But I had enough
sense to see that Rajiv could help me grow my business both tactically and
strategically. Philly.com became an early leader among newspaper websites, and
much as I enjoyed taking the credit, I knew where the real credit lay.</p>

<p>After more than five years in Philadelphia and the
development of many unique and creative online publishing successes, I proudly
recommended Rajiv to Knight Ridder Digital’s headquarters office in California
for promotion to network-wide responsibilities. At KRD, his technical expertise
and project management skills were greatly prized. And his ability to lead a
team of people was fully recognized. The situation at KRD was not an easy one;
there was no shortage of aggressive would-be leaders vying for dominance in a
quickly growing company. Many were either very talented, or were very good at
pretending to be. It was a politically-charged environment, not easy to
navigate. But through it all, Rajiv’s quiet strength and resolve made him stand
out. Throughout the company, people knew that Rajiv was smart, approachable,
loyal and dedicated. Plus they just plain liked him and liked working for him.
It’s a rare treat to find someone who has his talents who is also a truly nice
guy. His staff trusted his judgment in large part because it was always based
on both a wealth of technical knowledge <u>and</u> a clear desire to do what
was right for the company and its people. </p>

<p>After he left Knight Ridder, I no longer worked directly
with Rajiv. But I have followed his career with great interest. I could not be
more proud of his successes, or of the fact that he continues to be so highly
regarded in digital media circles. Sadly, I can no longer steal any credit from
his successes. But I take great joy in seeing how fully his great potential has
been realized. I count him as both my greatest hire and as a true friend. I
would be happy to discuss Rajiv and his work with you if that would be of
further help.</p>
