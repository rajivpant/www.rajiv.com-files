<p>To Whom It May Concern:</p>



<p>I have personally known <span class=SpellE>Rajiv</span> Pant
to be an outstanding professional since 1995 when he started working at
Philadelphia Newspapers. I watched his career and accomplishments as he grew
from programmer to manager, director and vice president of engineering over a
short period of six years. Over the years, he has built a reputation as a
highly respected technologist and expert problem solver.</p>



<p><span class=SpellE>Rajiv</span> did not limit his scope to
his own department, but was a technology consultant to the entire company.
People from other departments and offices regularly requested his help. His
strong desire for helping others and helping the company were exemplary. While
he helped others be successful, his work within his own department never
suffered as he led several successful projects.</p>



<p><span class=SpellE>Rajiv</span> has superior interpersonal
and communication skills. He gets along extremely well <span class=GramE>with</span>
employees across the organization. He is highly respected and liked, as both a
person and a professional, by senior management, colleagues, employees,
suppliers, and customers alike. His ability to work well with others and win
people over has helped him solve problems and get things done that seemed
insurmountable. People know him as a go-to problem solver who makes effective
use of technology. <span class=SpellE>Rajiv</span> was awarded the prestigious
Knight Ridder Excellence Award twice in his career.</p>



<p>From early on in his career, <span class=SpellE>Rajiv</span>
showed great leadership skills. He would take charge of a challenge until all
the issues were resolved and customers satisfied. People liked working with
him, and I frequently heard good things about how he helped them succeed. He
has shown the ability to quickly gain a solid understanding of the business and
customer needs, and how to get things done quickly and effectively. He has
repeatedly demonstrated a good vision for the future in strategies and
products.</p>



<p><span class=SpellE>Rajiv</span> is a resourceful, creative,
and solution-oriented person who is frequently able to come up with new and
innovative ideas and solutions. He is both a good leader and a follower. He is
an exceptional technologist, leader, manager, businessperson and worker all in
one.</p>





<p>When <span class=SpellE>Rajiv</span> decided to start a
consulting practice, I was saddened to see him leave. I wish him the greatest
success in his new undertaking. His presence, both as a person and as an
exemplary employee, will always be missed here.</p>
