"After surveying the landscape at Coxnet, Rajiv made a number of key changes in the architecture and operational norms there that brought much-needed efficiency and stability to the web hosting operations. As a leader, he has a remarkable talent for seeing the forest first and not immediately getting lost in the trees as he sets his plans. He is very much a solutions person, fueled by a strong curiosity and willingness to try out new ideas. I believe he is most effective in an environment that is highly collaborative; he enjoys the give and take of shaping an initiative or solving a problem. He thrives on open exchange. His collaborative spirit made him a great partner in multi-organizational projects and created a strong base of support among his direct reports. Perhaps most importantly, he does a very good job translating complexity for the technology-challenged. I valued his advice and very much enjoyed our opportunities to work together."

"Rajiv is very bright, hard-working, creative and passionate about his enginerring and development work on the internet. Rajiv never wants to do things the way they have already been done, Rajiv has always been top engineer in non-tech companies, requiring him to figure out how to get to the goal on his own. That is perhaps Rajiv's greatest strength - his resourcefulness and self-reliance."

The relationships he builds with his collegues are genuine and he is one of the first people I turn to for career advice."
