        <p>Young Global Leaders of The World Economic Forum is a
          community of about 900 exceptional leaders selected from every
          region of the world, from all walks of life, and every
          stakeholder group in society.</p>
        <p>Nominated at under age 40, these young leaders are assessed
          according to rigorous selection criteria that creates a
          diverse and representative body, while accepting only the very
          best leaders who have already demonstrated their commitment to
          serving society at large.</p>
        <p>Throughout their six-year tenure, YGLs are fully involved in
          the Forum’s meetings, initiatives and research and interact
          with the Forum’s wider multi-stakeholder community. YGLs have
          a powerful role in determining the community’s activities.
          They are governed by a foundation board of 14 respected
          leaders.</p>
        <p>The Forum of Young Global Leaders has three objectives:</p>
        <ol>
          <li>Collaboration: to build a diverse global community of
            peers who engage in networks and processes that look for
            forward-looking and innovative solutions to the problems
            faced by humankind</li>
          <li>Learning: to transform the next generation of leaders
            through personal experiences that build knowledge and
            engender better understanding of global, regional and
            industry agendas</li>
          <li>Action: to positively impact global challenges by engaging

          <li>Project lead for the development and implementation of a
            new product for managing print ads for Philly Tech magazine.
            The magazine was in need of such a system to generate
            revenue and did not have the funding or the time to
            purchase, implement and maintain an expensive system. This
            system was developed and implemented 50% under budget and
            50% faster than they had targeted for. It continued to meet
            all their needs during the magazine's 3-year lifetime. It
            required minimal operational and maintenance costs. Also
            implemented the technology platform for Philly-Tech's web
            site.</li>
          <li>Served as technology consultant to General Manager and VP
            of Business Development of Philadelphia Newspapers for
            evaluation of company acquisitions specializing in online
            recruitment products. Participated in negotiations with
            Senior Management of prospective companies and conducted all
            technology related interviews with their employees to
            evaluate their products, services, technologies and
            long-term prospects.</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Achievements</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>Organized the technology department into development and
            operations teams. This resulted in improved focus, and
            allowed employees to better pursue their career growth.</li>

      <div class="description">
        <h3>Projects</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>Ideated and led the development of a web portal and search
            engine product called Finder that powered the Philly Finder
            (<a href="https://www.rajiv.com/work/com/phillyfinder/">link</a>)
            service for 5 years. This unique search engine and portal
            helped Philly.com become a comprehensive destination for
            Philadelphia related information. It resulted in improved
            search results and an increase in users, page views and
            advertising revenue.</li>
          <li>Led the development of an online Yellow Pages product. It
            was in production as a steady source of revenue for the
            online department for 4 years. This success resulted in the
            hiring of additional sales people to sell this product.</li>
          <li>Led development of the first web gateway to the legacy
            Atex publishing system for newspapers. This enabled
            reporters and editors to securely file stories from any web
            browser and was a paradigm shift in working remotely. This
            was a major advance over the old dial up systems that were
            unreliable, slow and expensive to maintain. This enabled
            journalists the freedom to work without their own laptops
            that required special software and configuration to dial up
            and interface with the legacy systems. This saved over 80%
            in costs.</li>

      <h3><span class="title">Programmer Analyst</span>, Philadelphia
        Newspapers (Knight Ridder)</h3>
      <div class="description">
        <h3>Projects</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>Designed and developed a job listings system for
            Philadelphia Newspapers' classified listings online. It
            powered Planet Jobs, the most popular job search web site in
            the Philadelphia area for over 3 years. Until Knight
            Ridder's co-acquisition of CareerBuilder, this product
            primarily sustained and strengthened the two newspapers'
            recruitment listings. Among other innovations, Planet Jobs
            was the first online job site that had a shopping cart
            feature where job seekers could save their selected job
            postings.</li>
          <li>Designed and led development of one of the first newspaper
            web publishing systems. This system called Pin, was in
            production for 4 years. This was arguably the first
            automated online newspaper publishing system in the world.
            It allowed Philadelphia Newspapers to compete favorably
            against other newspaper companies with much larger staffs.
            The automation of this system allowed editors and producers
            to focus on online journalism and build several award
            winning online products on it, including the acclaimed Black
            Hawk Down web site.</li>
          <li>Developed a personalized edition of the Philadelphia
            Inquirer and Philadelphia Daily News Newspapers called "The
            Clipper" which provided personalized news via the web and
            e-mail. This resulted in improved customer loyalty and
            helped build a database of over a hundred thousand
            registered users.</li>
          <li>Ideated and developed an online ad management system for
            web sites called AdMaster. This was an industry-first and
            Philly.com received industry wide interest from several
            competing companies for the product. This product enabled
            business people to sell and manage ads on the web sites
            without depending on technology or editorial people. This
            made advertising highly effective on the Philadelphia
            Newspapers web sites and was instrumental in helping the
            Sales Team win the 1997 Editor and Publisher EPPY award for
            Best use of Advertising on a Newspaper Web Site (<a
href="https://www.rajiv.com/resume/references/1997_Philly_Best_Use_of_Advertising_Award.pdf">link</a>).</li>
          <li>Developed the first Internet e-mail gateway for the
            Philadelphia Newspapers legacy Atex publishing system. This
            enabled journalists to file and retrieve stories via e-mail.
            People in the newsrooms found this a revolutionary way to
            work. This created enormous cost and time savings for
            journalists in multiple locations around the world.</li>
          <li>Led development of the system for content management,
            publishing and co-branding for The Sports Network (<a
              href="http://www.sportsnetwork.com/">link</a>), a partner
            company of Knight Ridder. After being in production for 5
            years, it continues to power the Sports Network Web site as
            well as the co-branded sports sites for dozens of their
            customers including the New York Times, Fox Sports, Comcast,
            Tribune Media, Cox Interactive, Knight Ridder, Media General
            and many others. The use of this product has been a very
            significant portion of the Sports Network's revenue and
            business model. It enabled them to transition from a sports
            wire service to an Internet based media and content
            distribution company.</li>
          <li>Developed the Philly.com web development and hosting
            division for other organizations' web sites. This provided a
            steady stream of revenue to our online department for 5
            years. Besides being a profitable business venture, it
            enabled Philadelphia Newspapers to build strong
            relationships with several organizations in the Philadelphia
            area like the Chamber of Commerce and Genuardis Family
            Markets and helped build stronger ties with major newspaper
            advertisers. This led to increase in revenues by 10%.</li>
          <li>Served as the lead developer of a product for the Franklin
            Institute Science Museum in Philadelphia that enabled over a
            million visitors to the museum to instantly publish their
            personal web pages along with their digital photo on the
            museum's web site. In recognition of this work, Rajiv's name
            was imprinted on the wall inside the museum along with
            individuals and organizations that donated money or work to
            the museum's CyberZone section.</li>
