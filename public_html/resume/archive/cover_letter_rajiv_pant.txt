Dear Executive Recruiter,

My experience is in heading up technology and product development. I am presently Vice President of Engineering at Knight Ridder Digital. After eight years of several successful projects and industry awards at Knight Ridder, I am seeking a new opportunity to make a difference and to further my career.

Being young, single and mobile, I am happy to relocate for the right job.
 
Enclosed please find my resume and a presentation summarizing my work profile.

<optional>
I'm particularly interested in companies related to media, content management and software product development. I would be equally interested in a role that involved technology/product strategy and evaluation of vendors.
</optional>

<optional>
The Philadelphia, New York and New Jersey areas are of particular interest to me since my brother lives there and I own a house there. However, I'm not limited to that area. I'm currently based in San Jose, CA.
</optional>

I will call you next week to discuss if you may know of any opportunities for me.

Thank you,

-- Rajiv Pant
